This is a cross platform react listview example. It uses node webkit/electron for desktops ( windows, linux, osx ) and react-native for ios and android(not available yet). 

This project shows a list of images. The data for the list of images is obtained from embedded (jxcore on ios) rest service built using express and nedb. The data layer is the same for all platforms where as the ui differs for desktops , ios and android. Here is a gif of how it looks on different platforms
